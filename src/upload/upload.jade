            p Ever left your Garmin running at the end of a ride? All your hard earned averages declined pointlessly? 
            p This simple editor enables you to delete points from a file, recalculates aggregate ride data, and returns a new copy of the file.
            p To start, upload a '.tcx' file. You can convert a .fit file to .tcx using <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/"> Garmin Connect's</a> export functionality.
            p <strong>Note:</strong> This app is tested with Edge 800 (firmware 2.6) data. YMMV, but other users (including with Garmin 610) report success. 
            p No copy of the data processed is kept.
